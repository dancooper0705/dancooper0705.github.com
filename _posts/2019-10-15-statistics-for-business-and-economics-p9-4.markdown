## question
```
Because of high production-changover time and cost, a director of manufacturing
must convince management that a proposed manufacturing method reduces cost
before the new method can be implemented. The current production method operates
with a mean cost of $220 per hour. A research study is to be conducted in which
the cost of the new method will be measured over a sample production period.
a. Develop the null and alternative hypotheses that are most appropriate for the
study.
b. Comment on the conclusion when H0 cannot be rejected.
c. Comment on the conclusion when H0 can be rejected.
```

## discussion
```
H0: The population mean of operation cost of the new production method is
greater or equal to $220 per hour.
H1: The population mean of operation cost of the new production method is
less than $220 per hour.

If H0 is not rejected, then it couldn't be concluded that the new method
operates with less cost.

If H0 is rejected, then it could be concluded that the new method operatas with
less cost.
