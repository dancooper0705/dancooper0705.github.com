## question
```
The label on a three-quart container of orange juice claims that the orange
juice contains an average of one gram of fat or less. Answer the following
question for a hypothesis test that could be used to test the claim on the
label.
a. Develop the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.
b. What is the Type I error in this situation? What are the consquences of
making this error?
c. What is the Type II error in this situation? What are the consquences of
making this error?
```

## discussion
```
H0: Population mean of the weight of fat in a three-quart container of orange
juice is equal to or less than one gram.

H1: Population mean of the weight of fat in a three-quart container of orange
juice is greater than one gram.

Type I error is a situation in which the sample satisfiy H0 but is rejected.
Whie this happens, it could be concluded that the product is not qualified but
actually it's qualified.

Type II error is a situation in which the sample does n't satisfiy H0 but is not
rejected. It might fail to conclude that a product is not qualified while
actually it is not qualified.
