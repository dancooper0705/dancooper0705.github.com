## question
```
To test for any significannt difference in the number of bonus between
breakdowns for four machines, the following data were obtained.
```

Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4
--- | --- | --- | ---
6.4 | 8.7 | 11.1 | 9.9
7.8 | 7.4 | 10.3 | 12.8
5.3 | 9.4 | 9.7 | 12.1
7.4 | 10.1 | 10.3 | 10.8
8.4 | 9.2 | 9.2 | 11.3
7.3 | 9.8 | 8.8 | 11.5

```
a. At the alpha = 0.05 level of significance, is there any difference in the
population mean times among the four machines?
b. Use Fisher's LSD procedures to test for the equality of the means for
machines 2 and 4. use a 0.05 level of significance.
