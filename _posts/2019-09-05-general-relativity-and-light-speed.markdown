## synosis
The post discusses relativity and light speed.

## what does it mean that light speed is constant
Albert A. Michelson is the first American to receive the nobel prizes in physics. His contiribution was to measure the speed of light. The result is amazing. It shows that no matter where we are and how we are moving, the speed light we measure is always the same.

## what does it mean that light speed is not constant
Light speed is slower when it is closer to an object of great mass. Generally speaking, in a flat spacetime, the light speed is fast. In a curved spacetime, the ligh speed is slower. The more mass an object has, the more curved a spacetime is near the object.

## how do we know light speed is slower near an object of great mass
The light alwasy travels along the optimal path with minimum time.
Below are the three most common examples:
* light travels in straight line
* light reflection
* light refraction

The light refraction we observe from daily life is due to the fact that light speed is different at different medium. The refraction could help light spend more time in where the speed is fater and spend less time in where the speed is slower. Thus, light refraction path is the optimal path along which the light could reach the destination with minium time.

Due to the fact that light path is refracted by an object with great mass, such as the sun or a black hole. It implies that the refracted light path is the optimal path with minium time. Thus, it also implies that light speed is slower when it closer to an object with great mass.

## confused. please tell me light speed is constant or not
The light speed is actually different at different places. But no matter where we are, the light speed we measure is alwasy a constant. The reason is that the time is also different at differnet places. Below example shows how it works.
* When the light moves L meters at a place closer to a black hole, the light could move 2L meters at another place far away from the black hole.
* When the time passes T seconds at a place closer to a black hole, the time could pass 2T seconds at the other place far away from the black hole.
* The measurement of speed is moving distance divided by time. Since L/T == 2L/2T, the measured light speed is still constant.

## what could we know from general relativity
Its formula could help derive the time dilation at different places according to effect of mass. The formula are consistent with the fact that the light refraction path near an object of great mass. Beyond this, it also shows that the time stops inside a blockhole inside which we couldn't observe what's going on anyhow.
