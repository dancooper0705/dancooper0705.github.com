to 14 automobiles per month.
H1: The population mean of the sales unde the new bonus plan is greater than 14
automobile per month.

If H0 is not rejected, than the new bonus plan might not be able to increase the
automobile sales.

If H0 is rejected, than it could be concluded that the new bonus plan is helpful
